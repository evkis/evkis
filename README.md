## Hi, Iâ€™m Aleksandra Aalto ðŸ‘‹ 

- ðŸ”­  **I am data analyst/data scientist** with large industrial experience and in-depth knowledge of mathematics and statistics.

- ðŸ¥… 10+ years of participation in various number of research and development projects within different companies in EU 
as strength analysis engineer leaded me to gain strong analytical skills and ability to interpret complex data,
familiarity with statistical methods analysis methods and process improvement experience.
Deep knowledge of mathematics and curiosity in various processes broaden my interest in analytics in general and data science.

- ðŸŒ± Currently I am opened to implement my knowledge and expertise into the field of data science and analytics.

- ðŸ’» What can I do related to data analysis?
  
I use `Python` (`Jupyter`, `Google Colab`, `VS Code`, `PyCharm`) for data analysis (`pandas`, `polars`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`,`SciPy`, `statsmodels`, `Plotly`). Also I am big fan of `Julia`. I use `Tableau` and `Streamlit` to visualize the results and create dashboards.I work on joint projects through Jupyter Hub, using Git for team work. I have experience working on a remote server via the command line.I can write complex queries in `ClickHouse` and `PostgreSQL`. Based on the results of `A/B testing`, I can draw conclusions about the best version of the product. I have deep understanding of mathematics that lies behind the code. I have experience in conducting `statistical tests`, predicting prices based on `linear models`, and also have knowledge of `bootstrap` analysis methods.
I do understand how a product manager thinks and what value an analyst brings to the business, I can calculate `product metrics` and apply them to solve analytical problems.
